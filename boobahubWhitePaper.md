## Introduction
We are currently living in the golden age of the internet, and as a result of this, we are also living in the golden age of booba. Gone are the days of having to steal your dad’s Playboys, and fapping to the images in a JC Penny catalogue. At any moment you can instantly pull up booba. Small booba, big booba, black booba, blue booba, one booba, three booba. Not even Dr. Seuss could have imagined this. 
I started writing this when I was sober, and brimming with ideas. I am now drunk, and flirting with the waitress at this beer bar and my laptop out like some faggot. Fucking hell bros. Anyways, there’s an opportunity here to utilize the combined autism of the Boobahub group chat. 
What I’m proposing is a cross-chain NFT/Booba platform. Substrate for DOT uses Rust, and Solana projects are also built with Rust. I haven’t done any research on this matter, but I assume this would make deploying the Boobahub platform across both of these platforms a relatively straightforward task. 

## The Problem
Presently, there are no based NFT exchanges on DOT or Solana. Ethereum has all of the market share at the moment, and nobody has stepped up to fill the void on these other Layer 1s. At least not anyone cool. This gap leaves artists and memers alike trapped on Ethereum, paying out absurd amounts of money on gas just to have their work criticized by nature loving furries. 

## The Solution
Enter Boobahub. On our platform artists, shitposters, egirls, and anyone who feels like creating a NFT will be able to mint their work, and put it up for sale. Users will then be able to purchase these NFTs directly from the artists and subsequently will flex those NFTs on other people. 
Driving this market will be Boobahub’s token, $booba. $booba will act as both a currency, and as a “proof of based” system. Users and creators will carry out their transactions in $booba, and holding x amount of $booba will be required for creators to be able to mint their NFTs on our platform. It will be on the lower end, as we are for the people, but it will be required nonetheless. 
Users will also be able to stake their $booba in a process called Motor Boating. 

## Ponzinomics
Describe the Ponzinomics. Brief summary: Users pay creators in $booba. Creator gets x% of the $booba, the rest is added back to the staking rewards pool as a service fee. Creators are free to sell $booba on the open market, or stake it themselves. Also considering some sort of burn mechanism to reduce the supply of $booba as time wears on
Users who have staked their $booba will be paid out from the rewards pool, no new tokens will be minted and added to the supply.
